# Now for your assignment.  Write a new program by combining the two example scripts you have already used. 
# Mash these two programs together so that the X, Y, and Z accelerations measured by your accelerometer are displayed on your little OLED display.  
# And convert and scale the values to m/s2, rounded to two or three decimal places.  
# So, when it's just sitting flat on the table, the z-acceleration should be roughly 9.81 m/s2.  Feel free to play with font faces and sizes.

# Use SDA and SCA? 9.81 m/s^2? Show accelerometer data on OLED
# How to clear screen/refresh?
# Import i2c maybe?
