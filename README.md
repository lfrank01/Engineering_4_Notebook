# Engineering_4_Notebook - Work in Progress
This repository contains documentation of Engineering 4 assignments and projects.

Note to self: for each assignment's documentation, there should be the assignment description, evidence, wiring (if applicable), and reflection.

# Basic Overview:

### Assignment Description
Write your assignment description here. It should be at least a few sentences.

### Evidence 
Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here.  You need to communicate what your thing does. For code only assignments like the Python calculator, include a screenshot of the output of the code.

### Wiring
This may not be applicable to all assignments. Anything where you wire something up, include the wiring diagram here.

### Reflection
What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience?  Your ultimate goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!


## Python_Dice_Roller

### Assignment Description

The Python Dice Roller assignment was the first Python assignments in Engineering IV besides the introductory Hello Python assignment. The purpose of the assignment was to create a Python program that could automatically roll dice. In addition, the program had to take user input of whether it would re-roll or exit the program after it had done its initial roll. For the spicy part of this assignment, the program had to also take user input on the number of sides that the dice should have and also how many dice were to be rolled. The spicy part also had to give the user the option of changing the settings in addition to choosing to either exit the prom or re-roll

### Reflection






Okay so I am giving you a freebie so you have an example of the kind of reflections that I want. I'll start you off with an example for dice_roller.py, then its up to you to start your reflections with the Python calculator and all subsequent assignments. You can delete this section from your personal readme. 

### Assignment Description

The purpose of this assignment was to create a program that can automatically roll dice. The program also took user input to decide whether another dice should be rolled, or if the program should exit. The spicy version added complexity by asking the user to specify the number of sides on the dice and the number of dice to be rolled at a time. The user was then asked whether they wanted to roll again with the same settings, change the settings, or exit the program.

### Wiring

N/A

### Reflection

This assignment was relatively simple, but was challenging because I had not coded in Python for several months. I learned that I could import parts of toolboxes without importing the entire thing, but that changes the syntax of how I call the function later. I also learned about using a while loop to control whether a user wants to exit the program. For the spicy version, I needed to use nested loops. Python determines what is inside a loop by the indent level of each line of text, rather than brackets like some other coding styles. That means I need to be really careful with my tabs!


## Python_Calculator
